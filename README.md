# Flashcard-App

Problem Statement:

There is the need for a convenient and efficient method of memorizing information for students, professionals, and anyone else who needs to retain large amounts of information
quickly and easily. Flashcards are well suited for this. However, traditional flash cards can be time-consuming to create, disorganized, and can easily get lost or damaged,
moreover reviewing traditional flash cards is not efficient and prioritizing them is a tedious task.


Solution : 

The solution to a flashcard application would involve designing and developing a software application that allows users to create, edit, and study digital flashcards.
The app would automatically suggest users different cards by predicting their memory decay. This is achieved by using the spaced repetition algorithm. This algorithm uses
the idea that the more times a person successfully remembers a piece of information, the longer they can go before they need to review it again. The algorithm calculates an 
optimal time to review each flashcard based on the user's previous performance with that card, and presents the card for review at that time. If the user successfully 
remembers the information again, the algorithm adjusts the review interval for that card, making it longer. If the user struggles to remember the information, the algorithm 
adjusts the review interval to be shorter.The application will thus help automate the scheduling of flashcards for review and save time and effort while also improving the 
effectiveness of the learning process.
